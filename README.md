# OSQ: A QEMU-Based Linux Distribution

## Overview

OSQ (Operating System QEMU) is a Linux distribution that uses the power of QEMU (Quick Emulator) to provide a flexible and efficient virtualization experience. This project aims to simplify the process of running and managing virtual machines while offering the robustness of a Linux-based system.

## Features

- **QEMU Integration**: Seamless integration with QEMU for efficient virtualization
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified VM management for both beginners and advanced users
- **Customizable**: Easy to tailor for specific use cases or hardware configurations
- **Resource Efficient**: Optimized to run smoothly on a variety of host systems
- **Wide Compatibility**: Supports a broad range of guest operating systems

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- Any x86_64 AMD-V or Intel VT-X cpu
- 566 MB of ram
- 
### Installation

1. Download the OSQ ISO from our [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/OSQ/releases)
2. Create a bootable USB drive using tools like Etcher or Rufus
3. Boot your system from the USB drive
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to install OSQ

## Usage

After installation, you can start creating and managing virtual machines through our intuitive GUI or via the command line. Refer to our [documentation](https://docs.osq.example.com) for detailed instructions.

## Contribution

Any help is greatly appreciated. This is a passion project of mine that I'm working on before I get my next computer. Please note that I don't know Haskell, which is used for XMonad configuration.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3. Make your changes and commit them with a clear, descriptive message
4. Push your changes to your fork
5. Submit a pull request with a description of your changes

Even if you're not familiar with Haskell or XMonad, you can still contribute in various ways:

- Improving documentation
- Suggesting new features or improvements
- Reporting bugs
- Helping with general code organization and structure

All contributions, big or small, are welcome!
